# SPI-Slave-with-Single-Port-RAM
Designing SPI Slave with Single Port RAM using Questasim and Vivado.



The PDF file will have snippets of the following:
1) Snippets from the waveforms captured from QuestaSim for the design with inputs assigned values and output values visible.
2) Synthesis snippets for each encoding
  • Schematic after the elaboration & synthesis
  • Synthesis report showing the encoding used
  • Timing report snippet
  • Snippet of the critical path highlighted in the schematic
3) Implementation snippets for each encoding
  • Utilization report
  • Timing report snippet
  • FPGA device snippet
4) Snippet of the “Messages” tab showing no critical warnings or errors after running elaboration, synthesis, implementation and a successful bitstream generation.
